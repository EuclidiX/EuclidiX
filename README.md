- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EuclidiX
- I'm an undergrad currently working on my degree in mathematics and statistics. I've recently taken up python projects as a little hobby of mine to challenge my coding skills.
As of right now I'm working on manim animations; I plan to look into some data science related projects soon as well.

 - My interests in mathematics are combinatorics, generating functions, discrete mathematics, probability, graph theory, geometry, and statistics.
